# LED_-_BUZZER_ARDUINO_UNO_PROJECT
Are you ready to take your Arduino skills to the next level? Here's an exciting project where we control an LED and a buzzer using a joystick. This project is perfect for beginners looking to explore how inputs like joysticks can interact with outputs like LEDs and buzzers.

What Youâ€™ll Need:
Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
Joystick module
LED (any color)
Resistor (220 ohms for the LED)
Buzzer
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Circuit Diagram:
Joystick:

VRx to Analog Pin A0
VRy to Analog Pin A1
SW (Button) to Digital Pin 2
GND to Arduino GND
VCC to Arduino 5V
LED:

Connect the positive leg (anode) to a 220-ohm resistor and then to Digital Pin 8.
Connect the negative leg (cathode) to GND.
Buzzer:

Connect the positive pin to Digital Pin 9.
Connect the negative pin to GND.
